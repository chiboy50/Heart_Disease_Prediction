# Heart_Disease_Prediction
This project is to build a model to accurately predict the likelihood of a new patient having heart disease in the future. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 17.9 million people die from cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) every year.

There are multiple risk factors that could contribute to CVD in an individual, such as unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, or mental illness. Identifying these risk factors early on could help prevent many premature deaths.

This project data is gotten from a company who has collected anonymized data from multiple hospitals on several patients. The dataset includes relevant information for each patient, such as their personal information and some medical data, including whether or not they have had heart disease before.
